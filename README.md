Through Pythonâ€™s scikit-learn library, three supervised ML algorithms: Decision Tree, KNN, and SVC, were explored and utilized. 
- Optimal hyperparameters of such algorithms were identified and tuned in order to create models used
in performing binary classification for the defaulting of credit card clients.
- Refer to the written article Predicting Default of Credit Card Clients Using Three Supervised Machine.pdf for more information, or any of the DoCCMLResultsFINAL (HTML, pdf, ipynb) files for the code of the Machine Learning!
